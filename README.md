# Reinforcement Learning Rubiks Cube Visualizer and Solver

## Description
This project features a 3D Rubik's Cube visualizer and an advanced reinforcement learning-based solver using the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm. The visualizer was developed in Python with matplotlib, leveraging quaternion mathematics to rotate the cube in 3D space. The Rubik’s Cube visualizer was built using the [MagicCube repo](https://github.com/davidwhogg/MagicCube/tree/master) written by David W. Hogg and Jacob Vanderplas. It also implements a modified form of the ADI (Autodidactic Iteration) algorithm for solving the Rubik's Cube, based on the research paper: [Solving the Rubik’s Cube Without Human Knowledge](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.07470).
